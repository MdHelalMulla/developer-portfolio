            <h1> <span class="captain">Captin America's</span> world </h1>
            <h3>Leader and a hard working person</h3>
            <p>know anything about the comic books, but watched a lot of documentaries and films about World War II in
                preparation for the role, calling Band of Brothers "very helpful". About the role, Stan stated, "Steve
                Rogers
                and Bucky are both orphans and kind of like brothers. They kind of grow up together and look after each
                other.
                It's a very human, relatable thing... I also wanted to look out for how their relationship changes once
                Steve
                Rogers becomes Captain America. There's always a competition and they're always one-upping each other. I
                paid
                attention to how Bucky is affected by Steve's change and suddenly Steve is this leader </p>
